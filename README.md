### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Marc, a full stack web developer focused on Front End, based in Paris. 

ðŸŒ± After a 2 month bootcamp at Ironhack Paris, Iâ€™m currently learning Redux and NextJS.
ðŸ’š I love design, and my main goal is to merge graphic design and front-end development to offer memorable digital experiences.
